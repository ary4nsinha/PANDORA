# PANDORA
Python-based Automated Number Plate Detection and Opening/Notification Response Apparatus
PANDORA is an innovative and efficient project that leverages the power of Python computer vision libraries and Raspberry Pi technology to create an automated system for identifying vehicle number plates and facilitating secure access control. This intelligent apparatus is designed to enhance the security and convenience of gated societies or restricted areas.

Using advanced computer vision algorithms, PANDORA can accurately detect and recognize number plates of vehicles entering the premises. When a resident's vehicle is identified, the gate is automatically opened, providing seamless entry. However, in the event of an outsider's vehicle approaching the gate, PANDORA promptly sends real-time notifications to the concerned authorities, ensuring proactive security measures.

The integration of Python-based automation enables PANDORA to process image data swiftly, making it highly responsive to incoming vehicles. The system's ability to learn and adapt over time further improves its accuracy and recognition capabilities, minimizing false identifications and false alarms.
